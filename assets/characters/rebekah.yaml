info:
- note: Rebekah offered Abraham's servant, who had been tasked with finding Isaac
    a wife, water for him and his camels. This was the sign the servant had asked
    God for to find the woman who was appointed to be Isaac's wife.

  commentary: Rebekah's family asked if she could stay 10 days before leaving, but
    she said she was willing to leave. This blessing is the same blessing that the
    angel of the LORD gave to Isaac in Gen 22:15-17
- note: Isaac met his father's servant in a field with Rebekah and Isaac took her
    to her mother's tent and married her.
