- note: Abraham took his son Isaac to the place the LORD asked him to sacrificce him.
    He built the altar, bound Isaac, and laid him no the wood. Abraham lifted his
    knife to slaughter Isaac, but the LORD called out to him, telling him to stop,
    that he truely does fear the LORD, and provided a ram to replace Isaac as the
    sacrifice.
