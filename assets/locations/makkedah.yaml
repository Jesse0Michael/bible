- note: Where the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon fled to
    and were executed and burried at after trying to attack the Gibeonites after they
    made peace with Israel. But God fought the battle against them, hurling stones
    from the heavens and keeping the sun in its place
