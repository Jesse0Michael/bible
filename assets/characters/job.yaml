info:
- note: Blameless and upright. Feared God. Was very wealthy and prosperous, had a
    healthy, large family.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.1-2
- note: Satan accuses God that Job is only blameless and upright because God has protected
    him and given him all things, but if he didn't have those blessings he would curse
    God too his face. God allows Satan to touch everything around Job, but not Job
    himself.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.9-12
- note: In one moment, 4 messengers come to tell Job that his oxen and donkeys were
    killed by Sabean raiders, his sheep were killed by fire from heaven, his camels
    were killed by Chaldean raiders, and his children were all killed in a house that
    collapsed. Even after all this Job tore his robe and worshiped God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.13-22
- note: Satan tells God that, though Job still praised him when his possessions and
    children were taken from him, He will surely curse God if his own life was effected.
    God allowed Satan to afflict Job, as long as he did not kill him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.4-6
- note: Satan covered Job's body with sores.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.7-8
- note: Even as His wife asked Job to curse God, he would not.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.9-10
- note: Three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, came to Job to comfort him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.11
- note: Job's friends wept, tore their robes, sprinkled dust on their heads, and sat
    with Job for 7 days and 7 nights and no one spoke a word.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.12-13
- note: Job curses the day he was ever born, and wishes he was never conceived.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job3.3-10
- note: He wishes he would have died at child birth, or been born dead, rather than
    to experience the things he had experienced.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job3.11-19
- note: He wishes he was dead, and longs for it, but still has not cursed God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job3.20-26
  commentary: Job acknowledges God's role in surrounding him with suffering, but does
    not curse him.
- note: Job claims God is the source of his suffering, but does not curse him for
    it.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job6.4
- note: Job's friends have asked him to repent from the sin he made that they believe
    caused his suffering. Job asserts his innocence and asks his friends to stop with
    the harsh accusations and instead give him kindness and compassion
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job6.28-30
- note: He looks forward towards his death and expects it to come soon.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job7.6-10
- note: Job turns his complaints to God. He asks why God has treated him so harshly
    and asks God to leave him alone.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job7.11-21
- note: He argues that he would never be able to get an audience with God, and if
    he did God would not listen. He asserts that he is blameless, but God would not
    be summoned to hear his case.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job9.11-21
- note: Job claims, that since he is blameless and that God will not hear his case
    that God is unjust, allowing the destruction of both the wicked and the blameless.
    He knows that if he moves on from his sorrow all will judge that Job was not innocent
    and condemn him for the sin he must have committed. He desires a trial with God
    that his innocence may be pleaded and that God will lift the oppression from him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job9.22-35
- note: Job pleads to God directly asking for an answer to why he is oppressing him.
    He knows God knows he is innocent. For he does not see as man sees, He has made
    Job and knows he is not guilty.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job10.2-9
- note: He asks God that if he has sinned or is guilty to not remove the affliction
    from him, but if he is judged right to remove the affliction and lift his head
    for he cannot do that on his own because he fears that God would hunt him even
    more.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job10.14-17
- note: He asks God to leave him alone and let him die.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job10.20-22
- note: Job mocks his friends saying that no one is wiser than them.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job12.2-3
- note: Job extols God's wisdom, power, and control over all things. Both good and
    bad, and has the power to change either; lifting up and bringing down, empowering
    and destroying. He is in control of the deceiver and the deceived, the wise man
    and the drunkard, and can change their fate as he chooses.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job12.13-25
- note: Job states that he knows and understands what they are saying about God's
    justice. But he would rather speak with God, for he knows his innocents and his
    friends are only spreading lies.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job13.1-5
- note: Job warns his friends about speaking falsely for God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job13.6-12
- note: Job pleas his case to God and asks him to remove the suffering from him and
    give him and explanation as to why he is suffering.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job13.20-24
- note: Job reflects on the fragility of human life and that all humans are destined
    to live short lives. He asks that his life would end and that, like a tree has
    a chance to regrow, that he may be renewed. And in his renewed life, God put an
    end to his sin and cover up all of his iniquity.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job14.7-17
  commentary: The hope to have his sins covered in a new life would not be an admission
    of sin deserving of his current suffering. The hope in a resurrected life where
    all one's sins are wiped clean surely points to Jesus, without Job even realizing.
- note: Job continues to complain about how poorly and desolate God has treated him,
    blaming God for allowing this undeserved suffering.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job16.7-17
- note: Job has hope for a witness in heaven to plead his case before God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job16.18-22
  commentary: Job's hope may be in God's divine counsel, but our hope is in Jesus
    Christ, the one who intercedes and testifies for us.
- note: Job believes death is near and longs for it. He leaves his hope for vindication
    behind, saying that it will go down to Sheol with him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job17.12-16
- note: Job complains about the way his friends have treated him. He says that even
    if he did error, it would be his business, not something for them to use against
    him. He claims again that it is God who is unjustly trapped him, not a trap of
    his own making.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job19.2-12
- note: Job complains about how isolated this suffering has made him. How everyone
    he knew has departed and left him, and how those who were close have turned against
    him. He cries out to his friends for mercy, for it is God who has put his hand
    against Job and caused his suffering.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job19.13-22
- note: Job expresses hope in a redeemer who stand before him, as a witness, and testify,
    on his behalf, to God. He also warns his friends that their false judgement may
    bring upon the wrath of God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job19.25-29
  commentary: Job's hope for aa redeemer who will testify for us is the same hope
    that we have, as christians, in Christ, who will intercede for us on account of
    our sins before God.
- note: Job argues against his friends saying that the wicked don't perish, they actually
    prosper and live full lives. His friends would say that God is storing up iniquity
    for the children of the wicked, yet Job argues that that's not true. For he sees
    the wicked continue to prosper.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job21.7-21
- note: Job, again, cries for a counsel with God; that He would listen to and hear
    his arguments. But Job does not see God. Job thinks his case would come out as
    gold for he has kept God's commandments.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job23.3-12
- note: Job extols God's power, and combats the claims that he does not have the fear
    of God by explaining how he is terrified of God. But he is not silenced because
    of his fear, because he is not guilty.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job23.14-17
- note: Job argues that the poor and innocent suffer at the hands of the wicket who
    prosper. And God does not rectify the unjust situation.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job24.2-12
- note: Job says it is God who made his soul bitter, and will not speak anything that
    is untrue. Job clings to his righteousness.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job27.2-6
- note: Job calls for those who rise up against him be counted as wicked and unrighteous
    and be treated as so. He lists the punishments that should fall upon the wicked.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job27.7-23
  commentary: The perceived judgment on the wicked contradicts his earlier argument
    that the wicket don't actually get punished.
- note: Job asks where wisdom can be found. Not in the depths of the sea, not bought
    with jewels. Is it hidden death? God understands the way to it. The fear of the
    lord is the way to wisdom, and to turn away from evil is the path t understanding.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job28.12-28
- note: Job reflects on months passed when God watched over him, and blessed him,
    and called him his friend. When he was surrounded by his children and respected
    by his community. When he was called righteous for his deeds he'd done towards
    the poor and needy.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job29.2-17
- note: Job's reflection changes from how good things used to be to how awful things
    are now. How he is disrespected and ridiculed.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job30.1-15
- note: Job laments about his situation. How God has left him in the mire, and how
    he cries out for help but there is no one to help him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job30.16-31
- note: Job's final appeal iis one proclaiming his innocence. He lists several sins
    that he is not guilty of, and if he was, let God deal with him justly. He denies
    any lust, or deceit; committing adultery, or mistreating servants; being a lover
    of money or other idols; cursing an enemy or rejoicing in an enemies misfortune;
    withholding from the poor and needy or abusing the land.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job31.1-40
- note: After all the speeches are done, God shows up in a whirlwind to address Job.
    God does not answer Job's question about why he is suffering nor addresses his
    claim of innocence. God asks Job a series of rhetorical and sarcastic questions
    to demonstrated that he is God and much greater than humanity. God asks Job if
    he was present for creation or when he set the seas in their place. If he could
    command the land or sky or stars or animals to be.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job38.1-3
  commentary: God specifically mentions the storehouse of hail which later would be
    used when God fights a battle for Israel. He mentions several constellations by
    name.
- note: In response to God's first speech, in humility and meekness, Job responds
    to God saying how small he is in comparison to God and that he will not contend
    or speak against God on account of the glory that He just demonstrated with His
    questioning.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job40.1-5
  commentary: Job recognizes the futility of responding to God. He drops his demands
    for answers and acknowledges that he cannot know the wisdom that only God knows,
    of how the world works or God's purpose in his life.
- note: Out of a whirlwind, God challenges Job to be like God, to manage justice and
    punish the wicked as God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job40.6-14
- note: God uses the example of the Behemoth and the Leviathan and his power over
    them to demonstrate his power to Job.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job40.15-41.11
- note: Job repents of his challenging God and praises God with glory, acknowledging
    his power and that his purpose cannot be thwarted.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job42.1-6
- note: The LORD restored fortune to Job. God gave him twice as much as he had before.
    Brothers and sisters came with sympathy and offerings of money and gold. He was
    blessed with sheep, camels, oxen, and donkeys. He was given seven sons and three
    daughters and lived to be an old man.
