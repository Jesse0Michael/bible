- note: Moses chose Joshua to fight with Amalek. Moses would stand on the top of the
    hill with his staff raised up. When Moses hand was up, Israel prvaled, when it
    was down they faltered. When Moses was weary, Aaron and Hur put a stone under
    him for him to sit and held up his hands and Joshua overwhelmed Almalek

- note: The LORD called Moses to the mountain to give him the stone tablets conatining
    the law and the commandments. Moses went up with his assistant Joshua. The cloud
    covered the mountain for 6 days, on the 7th it called out to Moses. The appearance
    of the LORD was like a devouring fire on top of the mountain. Moses entered the
    cloud for 40 days and nights.

- note: Two of the chosen elders prophesied in the tent after the spirit rested on
    them, Eldad and Medad. Joshua asked Moses to tell them to stop, but Moses was
    not jealous for what God was doing.

- note: The LORD had Moses send spies into the land of Canaan, one from each tribe.

- note: The spies returned to Moses after 40 days and recounted that the land is flowing
    with milk and honey. They showed the fruit they collected from the land. They
    told people that they ran into, who were strong, and were affraid. Caleb said
    they should take the land.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Nu13.17-33
- note: After hearing the report on the land from the spies from each tribe, the Israelites
    complained to Moses and Aaron saying it would be better to have died in Egypt
    or the wilderness than to die by sword. Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes and
    cried that the land is extremely good and that they had God on their side and
    should take it.

- note: The LORD was going to smite down the people of Israel for their grumbling,
    but Moses spoke on their behalf. He conviced God to change his mind, but, the
    Israelites would wonder in the wilderness for 40 years until ever grown man who
    grumbled against God has died. Every man over 20 except Caleb and Joshua will
    not be able to enter the land, but it will be given to their children.

- note: The LORD killed every spy, who brough back a bad report, with plague, except
    for Joshua and Caleb.

- note: The LORD called Moses to mount Abarim to view the land he is going to give
    to Israel. God appointed Joshua to lead Israel after Moses was gone. Joshua was
    taken before Eleazar to be commissioned in fron of the entire congregation.
