- note: When Hagar concieved a son for Abram, Sarai looked on her with contempt and
    jealousy and Saraai dealt harshly with Hagar and she ran away from Sarai.

- note: An angel of the lord came to Hagar and told her to return to Sarai. The angel
    promised to multiply her offspring.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge16.7-10
  commentary: This is the first mention of God intervening with Sarai's and Abram's
    choice to take their childlessness into their own hands.
- note: The angel of the LORD told Hagar to call her son Ishmael because the LORD
    has seen her affliction

- note: After Abraham and Sarah had Isaac, Sarah asked Abraham to banish Hagar and
    Ishmael. God allowed Abraham to do so and he sent the mother and the child off
    with meager provisions to wander the wilderness.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge21.9-14
- note: When Hagar's and Ishmael's provisions were gone, Hagar left Ishmael under
    a bush to die. She walked out of earshot to weep. An Angel of the LORD came Hagar
    telling her to fear not, for the LORD has heard the boy. God opened her eyes to
    show her a well of water and they drank.

  commentary: For me, this is one of the saddest stories in the Bible. Though it does
    show God's compassion for the Widow and Orphan. Ishmael would be around 13-14.
