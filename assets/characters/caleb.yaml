info:
- note: The LORD had Moses send spies into the land of Canaan, one from each tribe.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Nu13.1-15
- note: The spies returned to Moses after 40 days and recounted that the land is flowing
    with milk and honey. They showed the fruit they collected from the land. They
    told people that they ran into, who were strong, and were affraid. Caleb said
    they should take the land.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Nu13.17-33
- note: After hearing the report on the land from the spies from each tribe, the Israelites
    complained to Moses and Aaron saying it would be better to have died in Egypt
    or the wilderness than to die by sword. Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes and
    cried that the land is extremely good and that they had God on their side and
    should take it.

- note: The LORD was going to smite down the people of Israel for their grumbling,
    but Moses spoke on their behalf. He conviced God to change his mind, but, the
    Israelites would wonder in the wilderness for 40 years until ever grown man who
    grumbled against God has died. Every man over 20 except Caleb and Joshua will
    not be able to enter the land, but it will be given to their children.

- note: The LORD killed every spy, who brough back a bad report, with plague, except
    for Joshua and Caleb.
