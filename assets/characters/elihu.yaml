info:
- note: Elihu had been watching Job and his friends' argue and became so angry he
    decides to interrupt them. He is angry with Job because of his self-justification,
    and angry with the friends because they found no answer to Job, yet did not cease
    blaming him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job32.1-5
- note: Elihu was hesitant to speak, because he is young and Job's friends' should
    be much wiser in their age, but he rebukes them for not refuting Job or answering
    any of his arguments.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job32.6-12
- note: Elihu rebukes Job's claims of being innocent and without sin by extolling God
    and how much greater He is than mankind. He rebukes Job for ever raising himself
    to God's level for God is so much greater than mankind.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job33.8-13
- note: Elihu argues against Job's claim of innocence and unjust treatment by saying
    that God will not act wickedly or pervert justice.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job34.10-15
- note: Elihu backs up his claim of God's justice by arguing that his justice is careful
    and see's all things. God see's every step and nothing is hidden from him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job34.21-27
- note: Elihu rebukes Job for dictating how God should Judge, and that in this he
    is rebelling against God and deserving of suffering for his reaction to God's
    judgment.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job34.31-37
- note: Elihu argues that God is so transcendent above humanity that a person's sin
    or righteousness does not affect Him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job35.5-8
  commentary: However, from the divine counsel, we know that God does have a stake
    in Job's righteousness.
- note: Elihu tries to speak on God's behalf, saying his words are righteous and come
    from his Maker. He extols God's righteousness and judgment, that he brings suffering
    to the wicked and watches out for the righteous.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job36.2-12
- note: Elihu again argues that God is so far above humanity. That he is the creator
    of all the earth's splendor and he cannot be found because he is so much greater
    than it.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job37.14-24
  commentary: It is ironic that immediately after this God reveals himself and answers
    Job.
