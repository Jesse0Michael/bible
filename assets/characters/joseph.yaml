    and Joseph's sheaf stood upright and the other sheaves bowed down to it. His brother

    over them.

- note: Jacob sent Joseph to pasture the flock with his brothers. Joseph heard they
    had went to Dothan. When he found them there, they conspired to kill him and throw
    him into a pit, planning to say that he was devoured by a fierce animal.

- note: Reuben saved Joseph by convincing their brother not to kill him, but only
    throw him in a pit. So Joseph's brothers took his robe and threw him in an empty
    pit without water. They sat down to eat and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites on their
    way to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph as a slave and they sold him for
    20 shekels of silver.

    but he refused. One day he grabbed his garment as he fled and called out to the
    men of the household claiming that Joseph had tried to rape her. When she told
    Potiphar this lie he threw Joseph in prison.

    God.

    Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and the LORD made him successful.
