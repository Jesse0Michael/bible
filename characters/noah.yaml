    heaven, but a single pair of unclean animals.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge7.1-3

    The law of clean animals has not yet been given, but Noah somehow new which animals
    were clean and unclean (maybe from God himself)

  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge9.11-17
- note: Like Adam, Noah became a worker of the ground. He planed a vineyard, made
    wine, got drunk, and layed uncovered in his tent. Ham, the father of Canaan, saw
    his father's nakedness and told his brother. Shem and Japeth covered their father.
    When Noah woke and learned what happened, he cursed the line of Ham saying they
    would be servants to his brothers. Noah blessed Shem, that Canaan would be his
    servants, and blessed Japeth that God would enlarge his family and Canaan would
    be his servants.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge9.20-27
  commentary: It is possible that all Ham did was literally see his father naked and
    that insulted him, but some would interpret it to mean Ham had sex with his father.
    But most would interpret it that he had sex with his mother. Hence why the curse
    lies on Canaan, not Ham.
- note: Lived to be 950 years old
