info:
- note: God commanded Abram to leave his country and his family for a land that He
    will show him. God promised to make him a great nation and will bless him and
    those who bless him, and curse those who dishonor him.

- note: Abram moved to the land of Canaan, to the Oak of Moreh in Shechem, where Abram
    built his first recorded altar to God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge12.5-7
- note: Abram moved to the hill country east of Bethel and built an altar to the LORD.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge12.8-9
- note: Because of a famine Abram went to Egypt. He told his wife to lie and say she
    was his sister, because she was very beautiful and the Egyptians will want to
    take her for their own. When they did, God afflicted Pharaoh and his house with
    great plagues and Pharaoh sent them away.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge12.10-20
  commentary: This a very interesting encounter. By any observation, one would think
    that what Abram did was wrong and sinful, but God used it to get them out of Egypt
    and God does not chastise Abram for this.
- note: Abram left Egypt for Negeb. From Negeb he went east of Bethel to where he
    built his alter, and separated himself from Lot because their possessions were
    growing to greatly that it was causing strife.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge13.2-9
- note: God promised the land in Canaan to him and his offspring. God promised to
    make his offspring as numerous as the dust of the earth. Abram moved to the oaks
    of Mambre in Hebron and built the LORD another altar.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge13.14-18
- note: When Abram learned his nephew Lot was captured, he took 318 of his trained
    men in pursuit of him. He divided his forces and attacked at night and brought
    back Lot, his possessions, and his people.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge14.13-16
- note: Abram gave Melchizedek one tenth of everything for the blessing he gave him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge14.20
- note: The king of Sodom asked Abram for his people in exchange for all the goods
    taken from Abram's battle, but Abram took none of the possessions from the king
    of Sodom, so that he would not be in his debt.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge14.21-24
- note: God speaks to Abram again, and in his frustration Abram complains that he
    is childless. God promises Abram that his offspring will match the number of stars
    in the sky.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge15.1-6
- note: God reminds Abram of the promise of the land he will give him, but Abram asks
    how he can know that he will possess it. God instructs Abram to get a heifer,
    goat, ram, and pigeon and cut them all in half and waited for the sun to go down.
    Abram fell into a deep sleep and God warns Abram that his offspring will be sojourners
    in a land that's not theirs be afflicted for four hundred years. But then God
    will bring judgement on that nation and bring them out and return to this land
    in the fourth generation.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge15.7-16
  commentary: Cutting animals in half was a common practice for ancient covenants.
    God mentions that land is not yet Abram's because the iniquity of the Amorites
    is not yet complete. This shows that God isn't acting on favoritism and that the
    other nations are given time to trust and obey the LORD but fail to.
- note: God completes the covenant unilaterally as Abram is taken over by the deep
    sleep. A smoking fire pot and flaming torch pass through the cut animals. God
    promises to give the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates to Abram
    and his offspring.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge15.17-21
  commentary: The smoke and fire that pass through the animals is a symbol for God
    as he is often portrayed as smoke and fire. The one sided nature of this covenant
    implies that God will keep the covenant regardless of Abram's ability to.
- note: Sarai convinces Abram to impregnate her servant Hagar to solve their childlessness
    themselves.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge16.1-3
- note: God asks Abram to enter a covenant with him. His name shall now be Abraham,
    and God will make him exceedingly fruitful and the father of many nations. And
    the LORD will give his offspring the land of Canaan and will be their God for
    generations to come.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge17.1-8
- note: As a sign of the LORDs covenant, God instructs Abram and every male in his
    house, from eight days old and older, to be circumcised.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge17.10-14
- note: Abraham laughed at God when he told him that he will bare a son with Sarah
    because they are 100 and 90 years old. God insisted he would and instructed Abraham
    to name him Isaac. The LORD said he would bless Ishmael, make him multiply into
    a great nation, but it is Isaac with whom God will establish his covenant with.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge17.17-21
- note: After speaking with the LORD on the covenant, Abram circumcised ever male
    under his house that very day.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge17.23-27
- note: Abraham is visited by three men. Abraham rushes to prepare them refreshments
    and hospitality. They sit and eat by the Oaks of Mamre.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge18.1-8
- note: The three men from the LORD who visited Abraham that in one year, when they
    visit again, Sarah would have a son. Sarah overheard this from the tent and laughs.
    The LORD asks Abraham why Sarah laughed, saying 'Is anything too hard for the
    LORD'. Sarah denied laughing, but the LORD says he knows she did.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge18.9-15
- note: The men from the LORD set out to leave Abraham for Sodom and the LORD revealed
    his plans to Abraham. The LORD said, because of their oppression, injustice, and
    grave sin, that he is going to Sodom and Gomorrah to judge them.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge18.16-21
- note: Abraham intercedes for Sodom, asking that the LORD not sweep away the righteous
    with the wicked. First Abraham asks the LORD to spare the city if there is 50
    righteous people, to which the LORD agrees. Abraham then changes his request to
    45 righteous people, to which the LORD agrees, again. Abraham changes his request
    again to 40 people, and God agrees. Not letting up, he changes his request to
    30, and then to 20, and then to 10. All of which God agreed with Abraham's request
    to spare the city if there are 10 righteous people there.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge18.27-33
  commentary: A humbling encounter of letting your requests be known to God, and a
    grim portrayal of how evil these cities are.
- note: Abraham had sojourned to Gerar and told Abimelech, the king, that Sarah was
    his sister and the king took her. But God told Abimelech that he is a dead man
    because Sarah is Abraham's wife. Because he had not yet been with her, Abimelech
    begged for mercy to which God said it was him who kept Abimelech from sinning
    against God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge20.2-7
  commentary: This is the second time Abraham pulled this trick. This time there is
    some context of God's disapproval of the act, through him confronting Abimelech.
    Sarah was 90.
- note: Abimelech confronted Abraham who blamed his actions on there being no fear
    of God in this place, and tried even harder by saying they technically are brother
    and sister.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge20.9-13
- note: Abimelech sent Abraham and Sarah away with sheep, oxen, servants, and silver.
    In exchange Abraham prayed to God who healed Abimelech and those in his house,
    for the LORD had closed the wombs of all the women under Abimelech's house.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge20.14-18
  commentary: Again, Abraham profits from his deception.
- note: As God promised, Abraham and Sarah had a son in their old age whom they named
    Issac.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge21.1-7
- note: After Abraham and Sarah had Isaac, Sarah asked Abraham to banish Hagar and
    Ishmael. God allowed Abraham to do so and he sent the mother and the child off
    with meager provisions to wander the wilderness.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge21.9-14
- note: Abimelech asked Abraham to deal kindly with him as he has done for Abraham.
    Abraham confronts Abimelech on a well that belonged to Abraham. The two enter
    a covenant and Abraham gives Abimelech 7 ewe sheep as a witness that Abraham dug
    this well.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge21.22-32
  commentary: That place is called Beersheba which means \"well of the oath\" or \"well
    of seven".
- note: God asked Abraham to take his son Isaac and offer him as a burnt offering
    on one of the mountains. In the morning he took his son, 2 men, and everything
    he would needed.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge22.1-3
  commentary: God was clear upfront that Isaac was to be the sacrifice. Abraham showed
    no sign of hesitation. Perhaps his faith in God truly was that great.
- note: After a 3 day journey, Abraham and Isaac made it to the place God told them
    to go to. They walked to set up the sacrafice, Isaac carrying the fire wood. Isaac
    asked his father where the sheep they to sacrifice was. Abraham replied the LORD
    will provide a lamb.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge22.4-8
  commentary: 3 days is plenty of time to be filled with doubt and second guessing
    yoour faith, Abraham's faith appeaars to remain strong.
- note: Abraham took his son Isaac to the place the LORD asked him to sacrificce him.
    He built the altar, bound Isaac, and laid him no the wood. Abraham lifted his
    knife to slaughter Isaac, but the LORD called out to him, telling him to stop,
    that he truely does fear the LORD, and provided a ram to replace Isaac as the
    sacrifice.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge22.9-14
- note: After mourning Sarah's death, Abraham turned to the Hittites and asked to
    buy property so that he may bury his wife there. He bought a cave to be Sarah's
    tomb, and the field around it, from a man named Ephron for 400 shekels of silver.
