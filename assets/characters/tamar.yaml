info:
- note: After Er died, Judah told Er's brother, Onan, to take Tamar as his wife. Onan
    did not want to because the offspring they had would not be his. When Onan had
    sex with Tamar, he would waist his semen on the ground so she would not get pregnant.

- note: Judah told Tamar to wait at her father's house until Shelah was older. Then,
    when Judah's wife Bath-Shua died, Judah mourned and went to Timnah to shere sheep.
    Tamar took off her widow's garments and dressed like a prostitute and seduced
    Judah at the entrance to Enaim, since Shelah was grown and she had not been given
    to him. Judah offered the prostitue a young goat from his flock, and his signet,
    cord, and staff, until she received that. After the act, Judah went to send the
    goat to the prostitute, but she could not be found.

- note: Tamar was brought to Judah because she was pregnant. Judah was going to burn
    her for her immorality, but Tamar showd Judah his signet, cord, and staff and
    told him to identify the belongings and let her live, realizing that he was the
    father.
