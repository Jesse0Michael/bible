info:
- note: The king of Gerar
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge20.2
- note: Abraham had sojourned to Gerar and told Abimelech, the king, that Sarah was
    his sister and the king took her. But God told Abimelech that he is a dead man
    because Sarah is Abraham's wife. Because he had not yet been with her, Abimelech
    begged for mercy to which God said it was him who kept Abimelech from sinning
    against God.

  commentary: This is the second time Abraham pulled this trick. This time there is
    some context of God's disapproval of the act, through him confronting Abimelech.
    Sarah was 90.
- note: Abimelech confronted Abraham who blamed his actions on there being no fear
    of God in this place, and tried even harder by saying they technically are brother
    and sister.

- note: Abimelech sent Abraham and Sarah away with sheep, oxen, servants, and silver.
    In exchange Abraham prayed to God who healed Abimelech and those in his house,
    for the LORD had closed the wombs of all the women under Abimelech's house.

- note: Abimelech asked Abraham to deal kindly with him as he has done for Abraham.
    Abraham confronts Abimelech on a well that belonged to Abraham. The two enter
    a covenant and Abraham gives Abimelech 7 ewe sheep as a witness that Abraham dug
    this well.

- note: In the land of the Philistines, Isaac tells them that Rebekah is his sister.
    Abimelech catches on and confronts Isaac and warns anyone that touches Rebekah
    would be put to death.

  commentary: Isaac pulled the same scheme for self preservation that his father Abraham
    pulled twice. Abimelech was even involved in Abraham's last scheme
- note: King Abimelech, along with his adviser, Ahuzzath, and army commander, Phicol,
    came to Isaac asking for Isaac to take an coveneantt of peace because it is clear
    that the LORD has blessed him. They feasted, exchanged oaths, and departed.
