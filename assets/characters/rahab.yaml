- note: Rahab proclaimed that she knew the LORD has given the land to Israel and asked
    for saftey for her and her family when they take it. A scarlet cord in the window
    was to be the sign to leave that household unharmed. Then she helped the spies
    escape Jericho to return to the Israelites

- note: For 6 days, as God commanded, Joshua led the people of Israel, all the men
    of war, 7 priests with 7 trumpets, and the ark of the covenant around the city
    of Jericho one time. On the seventh day they marched around the city 7 times,
    and then shouted, for the LORD had delivered the city of Jericho to them. The
    walls of Jericho fell down flat and the city was captured, sparing only Rahab
    and her family.
