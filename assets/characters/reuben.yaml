- note: Reuben saved Joseph by convincing their brother not to kill him, but only
    throw him in a pit. So Joseph's brothers took his robe and threw him in an empty
    pit without water. They sat down to eat and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites on their
    way to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph as a slave and they sold him for
    20 shekels of silver.

- note: When Ruben learned that Joseph had been sold into slavery, he grieved and
    tore his clothes. The brothers conspired to tear and cover Joseph's robe in blood
    and tell Jacob that he'd been murdered by an animal. When Jacob heard this lie,
    he tore his clothes and mourned for many days, no one could comfort him.
