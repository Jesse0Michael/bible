info:
- note: On the way to Egypt God was angry and set out to kill (Moses or Gershom) but
    Zipporah interviened and circumcised Gershom with a flint and touched Moses' feet
    with the foreskin, relenting God's anger.

  commentary: It is likely that God was coming to kill Gershom, not Moses, for not
    having followed the Israel practice of circumcision.
- note: Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, brought Zipporah, his wife, and Gershom and
    Eliezer, his sons, to him in the wildernes. Moses told Jethro all of what God
    had done to deliver them from Egypt and Jethro rejoiced.
