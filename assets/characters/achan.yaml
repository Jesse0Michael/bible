- note: Joshua pleas with God for answers of why they were defeated at Ai. God tells
    him it was because of Israel's sin in taking the devoted things from Jericho when
    told not to. Which was done secretly by Achan

  commentary: The devoted things could have been idols, not just treasure or riches
- note: Joshua investigated all of the clans for the hidden plunder from Jericho and
    confronted Achan, who admitted to his sin. They laid the plunder before the LORD.
    All of Israel stoned Achan and burned them and their belongings with fire.
