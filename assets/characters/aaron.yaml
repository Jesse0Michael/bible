info:
- note: God told Aaron to meet Moses in the wilderness. Moses told Aaron of all that
    God has commanded him, the signs he is to perform, and that Aaron is to be his
    voice. They gathered the people of Israel, Aaron spoke the words, Moses did the
    signs, and they all believed, bowed, and worshiped.

- note: Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and asked to let the Israelites leave to hold
    a feast in the wilderness. Pharaoh refused and made the Israelites work harder
    by not giving them straw to make bricks and beat them when they did nott make
    as many bricks as when they were given straw.
