info:
- note: Moses chose Joshua to fight with Amalek. Moses would stand on the top of the
    hill with his staff raised up. When Moses hand was up, Israel prvaled, when it
    was down they faltered. When Moses was weary, Aaron and Hur put a stone under
    him for him to sit and held up his hands and Joshua overwhelmed Almalek

- note: The LORD called Moses to the mountain to give him the stone tablets conatining
    the law and the commandments. Moses went up with his assistant Joshua. The cloud
    covered the mountain for 6 days, on the 7th it called out to Moses. The appearance
    of the LORD was like a devouring fire on top of the mountain. Moses entered the
    cloud for 40 days and nights.

- note: Two of the chosen elders prophesied in the tent after the spirit rested on
    them, Eldad and Medad. Joshua asked Moses to tell them to stop, but Moses was
    not jealous for what God was doing.

- note: The spies returned to Moses after 40 days and recounted that the land is flowing
    with milk and honey. They showed the fruit they collected from the land. They
    told people that they ran into, who were strong, and were affraid. Caleb said
    they should take the land.
