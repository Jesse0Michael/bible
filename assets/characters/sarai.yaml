- note: The three men from the LORD who visited Abraham that in one year, when they
    visit again, Sarah would have a son. Sarah overheard this from the tent and laughs.
    The LORD asks Abraham why Sarah laughed, saying 'Is anything too hard for the
    LORD'. Sarah denied laughing, but the LORD says he knows she did.
