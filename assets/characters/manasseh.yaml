info:
- note: Joseph took his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, to his father and he blessed them
    both. But when Jacob blessed them he crossed his arms and put his right hand on
    Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh. Joseph tried to correct Jacob,
    but he refused. Both sons were blessed to carry on his namee and grow into a multitude
    of nations. Both great, but Ephraim's greater.
