    forth clusters of ripe grapes. Pharaoh's cup was in his hands and he pressed the

    return to his position. Joseph asked the cupbearer to remember him, so that he
    may be restored.

    had a dream. In his dream 7 healthy cows came out of the Nile and ate the reed
    grass, then 7 unhealthy cows came out of the Nile and ate the healthy cows. Pharaoh
    had a second dream where 7 ears of good grain grew out of one stalk, then 7 blighted
    ears grew out of it. Pharaoh's spirit was troubled and none of the Egyptian magicians
    or wise men could interpret the dream. His cupbearer remembered Joseph and told
    the Pharaoh how he interpreted his and the baker's dream and they came true. Pharaoh
    sent for Joseph who was cleaned up and told Pharaoh it is not him, but God who
    will reveal the meaning of the dream. Joseph says the 2 dreams are the same. the
    7 healthy cows and 7 good ears of grain are 7 years of are 7 years of healthy
    harvest, and the 7 unheaathy cows and blighted ears of grain are 7 years of famine.

    one fifth of the produce during the 7 years of plenty to have enough when the
    famine comes. Pharaoh decides that none could be as wise as Joseph, with the LORD

    All of Egypt came to Joseph to buy grain as well as those outside of Egypt because
    of how severe the famine was.

- note: When Joseph's brothers came to Egypt to buy food during the famine, he recognized
    them all, but they did not recognize him. Joseph was governor and treated them
    like strangers, calling them spies. His brothers pleaded that they are not spies,
    but 12 brothers, the youngest of which is with their father,  who came for food.
    Joseph said to validate their story, they must send for their youngest brother
    while one of them remain confined.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge42.6-17
- note: Joseph's brothers blame their suffering on what they did to Joseph. Reuben
    tells them that he told them to not sin against their brother. Hearing this Joseph
    turns and weeps, though the brothers did not know he understood them, for he has
    been using an interpreter.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge42.21-24

    them provisions for the journey. Simeon was bound and kept behind. The brothers
    discovered that they provisions had been refilled. They returned to their father,
    Jacob, and informed him that they must return with Benjamin but Jacob refused
    to send him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge42.24-38
  commentary: The brothers were afraid when they found their provisions refilled because
    they thought they would be accused of stealing it. Jacob refused to let Benjamin
    go because he had already lost Joseph, and now Simeon, and wasn't going to lose
    Benjamin as well.
- note: When Joseph saw his brothers return with Benjamin, he requested an animal
    be slaughtered for a feast and that they dine in his house at noon. The brothers
    thought this treatment was an ambush because of the money that was found in their
    bags and they confess to finding their provisions and money replenished. The brothers
    and Simeon were brought to Joseph's house.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge43.15-25
- note: When Joseph arrives at his home to eat with his brothers, they bowed down
    to him. When Joseph saw Benjamin he was overcome with emotion and rushed out to
    weep. When he returned they ate separately, Benjamin receiving more than any other.

  commentary: Joseph's brothers bowed down to him just like in his dream that led
    him to this place.

    and to put his silver cup in Benjamin's sack. The brothers were sent away and
    Joseph sent a steward to confront them about what they had. When they realized
    their bags have been filled, they tore their clothes and returned to the city.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge44.1-13
- note: Joseph's brothers returned to Egypt and fell before Joseph. Judah please that
    all of the brothers, not just Benjamin who was found with Joseph's cup, are now
    his servants. But Joseph says only Benjamin will stay as his servant, the rest
    can leave to their father.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge44.14-17
- note: Judah pleads with Joseph to take him as a servant, instead of Benjamin who
    was found with the cup that was planted on his belongings. Judah claimed responsibility
    for Benjamin's life and asked to take his place, a substitution.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge44.30-34
  commentary: How very christ like of Judah (the line of which Jesus comes from) to
    take the place for another. To become a servant. To take the *cup* for his brother.
- note: Judah offering to take Benjamin's place in servitude overwhelmed Joseph with
    emotion, he left to weep. He finally revealed to his brothers who he was. Joesph
    tells them not to be distressed for he sees that God sent him there to preserve
    their life. Joseph instructed his brothers to tell their father, Jacob, everything
    and come to live in Goshen where he will provide for them in the remaining years
    of famine. Joseph embraced his brothers and they wept.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge45.1-15
  commentary: The narrative of Joseph is so rich with God's work and character. That
    he can use the sin of Joseph's brother's for his will. Nothing is out of his control
    and can't be used for his purposes.

    brothers to travel and retrieve their father and offered them the best land Egypt
    had to offer.

    says that he can die now, for he has seen Joseph's face and knows he is alive.

- note: Joseph instructed his brothers to tell Pharaoh that they were all shepherds
    because they have been keepers of livestock since youth when he asked them their
    profession inorder to dwell in the land of Goshen, for sheperds were an abomination
    to the Egyptians.

    shepperds. Pharaoh gave them the land of Goshen and Jacob blessed Pharaoh

    so instead Joseph insttructed them to trade their livestock for food. The next
    year, when the famine was still bad, the Egyptians came with no money or livestock.
    Joseph instructed them to sell their land to Pharaoh to buy food. They did, and
    from then on They would have to give 1/5 of their produce to Pharaoh. Only the
    priests did not sell their land to Pharaoh.

    both. But when Jacob blessed them he crossed his arms and put his right hand on
    Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh. Joseph tried to correct Jacob,
    but he refused. Both sons were blessed to carry on his namee and grow into a multitude
