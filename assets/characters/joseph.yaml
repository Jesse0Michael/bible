    and Joseph's sheaf stood upright and the other sheaves bowed down to it. His brother

    over them.

    11 stars were bowing down to him. When he told his father, Jacob rebuked him for
    thinking he and his mothere and brothers would bow down to him.

- note: Jacob sent Joseph to pasture the flock with his brothers. Joseph heard they
    had went to Dothan. When he found them there, they conspired to kill him and throw
    him into a pit, planning to say that he was devoured by a fierce animal.

- note: Reuben saved Joseph by convincing their brother not to kill him, but only
    throw him in a pit. So Joseph's brothers took his robe and threw him in an empty
    pit without water. They sat down to eat and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites on their
    way to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph as a slave and they sold him for
    20 shekels of silver.

    but he refused. One day he grabbed his garment as he fled and called out to the
    men of the household claiming that Joseph had tried to rape her. When she told
    Potiphar this lie he threw Joseph in prison.

    God.

    Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and the LORD made him successful.

    with atteneding to them. One night they both had dreams which Joseph was able
    to intrepret.

    forth clusters of ripe grapes. Pharaoh's cup was in his hands and he pressed the
    grapes into his cup. Joseph said the 3 branches were 3 days and in 3 days he will
    return to his position. Joseph asked the cupbearer to remember him, so that he
    may be restored.

    were eating pharaoh'ss cakes out of the top basket. Joseph said the 3 baskets
    were 3 days and in 3 days Pharaoh will hang him and birds will eat his flesh.

- note: In 3 days, both dream interpretations came true. The cupbearer was restored,
    the baker was hanged.

- note: 2 years after Joseph inerepreted the dreams of the cupbearer and baker, Pharaoh
    had a dream. In his dream 7 healthy cows came out of the Nile and ate the reed
    grass, then 7 unhealthy cows came out of the Nile and ate the healthy cows. Pharaoh
    had a second dream where 7 ears of good grain grew out of one stalk, then 7 blighted
    ears grew out of it. Pharaoh's spirit was troubled and none of the Egyptian magicians
    or wise men could interpret the dream. His cupbearer remembered Joseph and told
    the Pharaoh how he interpreted his and the baker's dream and they came true. Pharaoh
    sent for Joseph who was cleaned up and told Pharaoh it is not him, but God who
    will reveal the meaning of the dream. Joseph says the 2 dreams are the same. the
    7 healthy cows and 7 good ears of grain are 7 years of are 7 years of healthy
    harvest, and the 7 unheaathy cows and blighted ears of grain are 7 years of famine.

- note: Joseph instructed Pharaoh to select a wise maan to oversee the land and save
    one fifth of the produce during the 7 years of plenty to have enough when the
    famine comes. Pharaoh decides that none could be as wise as Joseph, with the LORD
    on his side, and appoints Joseph to be second in command to rule over the land.

    All of Egypt came to Joseph to buy grain as well as those outside of Egypt because
    of how severe the famine was.
