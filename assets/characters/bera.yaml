- note: The kings of Sodom, Gomorrrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela went to battle in
    the Valley of Siddim against the kings of Elam, Goiim, Shinar, and Ellasar. The
    armies of Sodom and Gomorrah fled to the hill country and fell into bitumen pits
    and their enemies took all of Sodom and Gomorrah's possessions, including Lot
    who was living in Sodom

- note: The king of Sodom asked Abram for his people in exchange for all the goods
    taken from Abram's battle, but Abram took none of the possessions from the king
    of Sodom, so that he would not be in his debt.
