- note: Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses in jealousy. Saying that they have also
    heard from God. The LORD called the three of them to the tent of meeting and spoke
    from the cloud saying, for the prophets He speaks to them in dreams and riddles,
    but He speaks to Moses clearly, mouth to mouth. In anger the cloud left the meeting
    and Miriam's skin turned leperous. She was forced to stay outside of the camp
    for 7 days.
