# Bible ðŸ“–

Personal Notes and reflections on reading the Bible with the intention that this data may be used, some how, once collected.


>  *This year I have begun reading the Bible, starting from the Old Testament, again. This time in chronological order because I did not know that it was not in chronological order last time.

Maybe in some searchable UI that layed out family trees, maybe in some database, maybe in some CLI. I'm not sure. It's a lot of tedious work and it's likely that I give up, but here's my start.*
