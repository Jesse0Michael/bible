- note: When Joseph arrives at his home to eat with his brothers, they bowed down
    to him. When Joseph saw Benjamin he was overcome with emotion and rushed out to
    weep. When he returned they ate separately, Benjamin recieving more than any other.

  commentary: Joseph's brothers bowed down to him just like in his dream that led
    him to this place.
- note: Joseph's brothers returned to Egypt and fell before Joseph. Judah please that
    all of the brothers, not just Benjamin who was found with Joseph's cup, are now
    his servants. But Joseph says only Benjamin will stay as his servant, the rest
    can leave to their father.

- note: Judah pleads with Joseph to take him as a servant, instead of Benjamin who
    was found with the cup that was planted on his belongings. Judah claimed responsibility
    for Benjamin's life and asked to take his place, a substitution.

  commentary: How very christ like of Judah (the line of which Jesus comes from) to
    take the place for another. To become a servant. To take the *cup* for his brother.
- note: Benjamin was given 300 shekels of silver and 5 change of clothes from Joseph
    as provisions.
