info:
- note: Reuben saved Joseph by convincing their brother not to kill him, but only
    throw him in a pit. So Joseph's brothers took his robe and threw him in an empty
    pit without water. They sat down to eat and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites on their
    way to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph as a slave and they sold him for
    20 shekels of silver.

- note: Judah took Bath-Shua for his wife and she conceived 3 sons.

- note: Judah told Tamar to wait at her father's house until Shelah was older. Then,
    when Judah's wife Bath-Shua died, Judah mourned and went to Timnah to shere sheep.
    Tamar took off her widow's garments and dressed like a prostitute and seduced
    Judah at the entrance to Enaim, since Shelah was grown and she had not been given
    to him. Judah offered the prostitue a young goat from his flock, and his signet,
    cord, and staff, until she received that. After the act, Judah went to send the
    goat to the prostitute, but she could not be found.

- note: Tamar was brought to Judah because she was pregnant. Judah was going to burn
    her for her immorality, but Tamar showd Judah his signet, cord, and staff and
    told him to identify the belongings and let her live, realizing that he was the
    father.

- note: After some time, with Simeon still being held captive in Egypt, Jacob asks
    his brothers to return to Egypt to buy food. They refuse to go without Benjamin.
    Judah puts Benjamin's saftey as his responsibility

- note: Joseph's brothers returned to Egypt and fell before Joseph. Judah please that
    all of the brothers, not just Benjamin who was found with Joseph's cup, are now
    his servants. But Joseph says only Benjamin will stay as his servant, the rest
    can leave to their father.

- note: Judah pleads with Joseph to take him as a servant, instead of Benjamin who
    was found with the cup that was planted on his belongings. Judah claimed responsibility
    for Benjamin's life and asked to take his place, a substitution.

  commentary: How very christ like of Judah (the line of which Jesus comes from) to
    take the place for another. To become a servant. To take the *cup* for his brother.
- note: Jacob blessed Judah. His brothers will praise him and bow down to him and
    his hand shall be on the neck of your enemies. Judah is compared to a lion, and
    that his line will reign aas rulers, and be incredibly wealthy.
