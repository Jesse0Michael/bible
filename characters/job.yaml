    healthy, large family.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.1-2
- note: Satan accuses God that Job is only blameless and upright because God has protected
    him and given him all things, but if he didn't have those blessings he would curse
    God too his face. God allows Satan to touch everything around Job, but not Job
    himself.

- note: In one moment, 4 messengers come to tell Job that his oxen and donkeys were
    killed by Sabean raiders, his sheep were killed by fire from heaven, his camels
    were killed by Chaldean raiders, and his children were all killed in a house that
    collapsed. Even after all this Job tore his robe and worshiped God.

- note: Satan tells God that, though Job still praised him when his possessions and
    children were taken from him, He will surely curse God if his own life was effected.
    God allowed Satan to afflict Job, as long as he did not kill him.
