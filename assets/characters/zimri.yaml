    The Israelites began to worship Baal of Peor while
    near Moab. This angered the LORD and he begain to plague the people of israelites. Moses ordered the chiefs to kill anyone who has yoked themselves with Baal. A man, named Zimri, who brought a midianit woman, named Cozbi, into his family was brought before the tent of meeting and Phinehas piered the man and the woman with a spear, killing them both and ending the plague. The plague killed 24,000 Israelites.
