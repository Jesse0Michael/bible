info:
- note: Balak summoned Balaam to come curse Israel for him because he was afraid of
    them. Balaam spoke with God who told him that he could not go, so Balaam sent
    Balak's messangers away. Balak sent more messengers to Balaam and again he confided
    in God, which God said that he could go with the men, but only do what he told
    him.

  commentary: It is most interesting to have a record of the LORD speaking with and
    having a God Fearing relationship outside of Israel, his blessed people.
- note: The LORD was angry with Balaam for going with Balak's messengers and sent
    an angel to stand in his way. Balaam's donkey say the angel of the LORD with its
    sword drawn and turned and went in the field. Balaam struck the donkey and led
    it back to the road. The angel of the LORD appeared again between the vineyards,
    the donkey saw it and turned against the wall. Balaam pushed against the wall
    and stuck the donkey. Then, again, the angel of the LORD appeared in a narrow
    place and the donkey lied down. Balaam struck the donkey again. The LORD make
    the donkey speak to Balaam to plea why he has struck her 3 times. Balaam spoke
    with his donkey then the LORD opened his eyes to see the angel of the LORD with
    its sword drawn. Balaam bowed to the angel who told him that he came out to oppose
    Balaam because his ways are perverse. Balaam said that he has sinned for he did
    not know that the angel of the LORD stood against him and that he would return
    home. The angel told him to go with the men, but only speak what he will tell
    them.

  commentary: How bizarre and supernatural to have a record of a talking animal in
    the Bible.
- note: Balaam had Balak build 7 altars for 7 bulls and 7 rams. When they were sacrificed,
    God gave Balaam the words to give to Balak. He said that he cannot curse what
    the LORD has not cursed.

- note: Balak took Balaam to another location to try and curse a fraction of Israel.
    They build 7 altars and sacrificed 7 bulls and 7 rams. The LORD met Balaam and
    told him to tell Balak that the LORD will not lie or change his mind like man
    and has commanded Balaam to bless, not curse, Israel and he will do so. Balak
    asks Balaam to not bless Israel, but he responds that he must because it's what
    the LORD asked of him.

- note: Balak takes Balaam to another location. They built 7 altars and sacrificed
    7 bulls and 7 rams. Balaam  lifted his eyes and saw all of Israel camping tribe
    by tribe. Balaam blesses the tents of Israel and praises the LORD.

  commentary: Balaam's blessing echoes the blessing God gave Abraham. 'Blessed are
    those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you.'
