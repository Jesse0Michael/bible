info:
- note: The King of Moab at the time Israel wandered the wilderness. His kingdom was
    very fearful of the Israelites because of what the LORD had done to the other
    kings in the land.

- note: Balak summoned Balaam to come curse Israel for him because he was afraid of
    them. Balaam spoke with God who told him that he could not go, so Balaam sent
    Balak's messangers away. Balak sent more messengers to Balaam and again he confided
    in God, which God said that he could go with the men, but only do what he told
    him.

  commentary: It is most interesting to have a record of the LORD speaking with and
    having a God Fearing relationship outside of Israel, his blessed people.
- note: Balaam had Balak build 7 altars for 7 bulls and 7 rams. When they were sacrificed,
    God gave Balaam the words to give to Balak. He said that he cannot curse what
    the LORD has not cursed.

- note: Balak took Balaam to another location to try and curse a fraction of Israel.
    They build 7 altars and sacrificed 7 bulls and 7 rams. The LORD met Balaam and
    told him to tell Balak that the LORD will not lie or change his mind like man
    and has commanded Balaam to bless, not curse, Israel and he will do so. Balak
    asks Balaam to not bless Israel, but he responds that he must because it's what
    the LORD asked of him.

- note: Balak takes Balaam to another location. They built 7 altars and sacrificed
    7 bulls and 7 rams. Balaam  lifted his eyes and saw all of Israel camping tribe
    by tribe. Balaam blesses the tents of Israel and praises the LORD.

  commentary: Balaam's blessing echoes the blessing God gave Abraham. 'Blessed are
    those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you.'
