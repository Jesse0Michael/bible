- note: After Abraham and Sarah had Isaac, Sarah asked Abraham to banish Hagar and
    Ishmael. God allowed Abraham to do so and he sent the mother and the child off
    with meager provisions to wander the wilderness.

- note: When Hagar's and Ishmael's provisions were gone, Hagar left Ishmael under
    a bush to die. She walked out of earshot to weep. An Angel of the LORD came Hagar
    telling her to fear not, for the LORD has heard the boy. God opened her eyes to
    show her a well of water and they drank.

  commentary: For me, this is one of the saddest stories in the Bible. Though it does
    show God's compassion for the Widow and Orphan. Ishmael would be around 13-14.
- note: Ishmael grew up in the wilderness of Paran, and became an expert with a bow,
    and moved to Egypt.
