info:
- note: Israel grumbled in the wilderness for having nothing to eat besides manna.
    The LORD angrily send a win that brought quail all over the land, and while the
    people were still eating it, the LORD sent a plague on them. Israel burried the
    people who had the craving, therefore they called that place Kibroth-hattaavah
