- note: Five kings gathered their forces against the Gibeon for making peace with
    Israel. The Gibeonites begged Joshua to save them. Joshua marched all night to
    Gilgal. The LORD threw the attacking armies into a panic as Israel chased them
    off. The LORD threw large stones from heaven at the fleeing men.

  commentary: This victory was the LORDs, not Israels
