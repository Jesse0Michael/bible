- note: 'God asks Moses to bring his brother, Aaron, and his sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar,
    and Ithamar near. God proclaims that Aaron and his sons will serve as priests
    and will be adorned with skillfully crafted priest garments: a breastpiece, and
    ephod, a robe, a coat, a turban, and a sash'
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ex28.1-5
  commentary: God, the creator, says to speak to the skillful, who have been filled
    with the spirit, to craft the garments, an interesting comment on God's relationship
    to creativity.
