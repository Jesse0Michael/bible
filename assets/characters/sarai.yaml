- note: Because of a famine Abram went to Egypt. He told his wife to lie and say she
    was his sister, because she was very beautiful and the Egyptians will want to
    take her for their own. When they did, God afflicted Pharaoh and his house with
    great plagues and Pharaoh sent them away.

  commentary: This a very interesting encounter. By any observation, one would think
    that what Abram did was wrong and sinful, but God used it to get them out of Egypt
    and God does not chastise Abram for this.
- note: Sarai convinces Abram to impregnate her servant Hagar to solve their childlessness
    themselves.

- note: When Hagar conceived a son for Abram, Sarai looked on her with contempt and
    jealousy and Sarai dealt harshly with Hagar and she ran away from Sarai.

- note: God promised to Abram, now Abraham, a son to him and Sarai. And God said that
    Sarai shall now be called Sarah.

- note: The three men from the LORD who visited Abraham that in one year, when they
    visit again, Sarah would have a son. Sarah overheard this from the tent and laughs.
    The LORD asks Abraham why Sarah laughed, saying 'Is anything too hard for the
    LORD'. Sarah denied laughing, but the LORD says he knows she did.

- note: Abraham had sojourned to Gerar and told Abimelech, the king, that Sarah was
    his sister and the king took her. But God told Abimelech that he is a dead man
    because Sarah is Abraham's wife. Because he had not yet been with her, Abimelech
    begged for mercy to which God said it was him who kept Abimelech from sinning
    against God.

  commentary: This is the second time Abraham pulled this trick. This time there is
    some context of God's disapproval of the act, through him confronting Abimelech.
    Sarah was 90.
- note: As God promised, Abraham and Sarah had a son in their old age whom they named
    Issac.

- note: After Abraham and Sarah had Isaac, Sarah asked Abraham to banish Hagar and
    Ishmael. God allowed Abraham to do so and he sent the mother and the child off
    with meager provisions to wander the wilderness.

- note: Sarah lived to be 127 years old.
