info:
- note: On the way to Egypt God was angry and set out to kill (Moses or Gershom) but
    Zipporah interviened and circumcised Gershom with a flint and touched Moses' feet
    with the foreskin, relenting God's anger.

  commentary: It is likely that God was coming to kill Gershom, not Moses, for not
    having followed the Israel practice of circumcision.
