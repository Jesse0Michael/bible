info:
- note: After Er died, Judah told Er's brother, Onan, to take Tamar as his wife. Onan
    did not want to because the offspring they had would not be his. When Onan had
    sex with Tamar, he would waist his semen on the ground so she would not get pregnant.

- note: God put Onan to death for his wicked ways.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge38.10
  commentary: It's implied that not impregnanting Tamar to provide an offspring for
    his deceased brother Er is the wicked thing he did deserving of death.
