- note: The kings of Sodom, Gomorrrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela went to battle in
    the Valley of Siddim against the kings of Elam, Goiim, Shinar, and Ellasar. The
    armies of Sodom and Gomorrah fled to the hill country and fell into bitumen pits
    and their enemies took all of Sodom and Gomorrah's possessions, including Lot
    who was living in Sodom

- note: When Abram learned his nephew Lot was captured, he took 318 of his trained
    men in pursuit of him. He divided his forces and attacked at night and brought
    back Lot, his possessions, and his people.

- note: The angels that visited Abraham arrived at Sodom to judge it. Lot spotted
    them and invited them to stay with him, eat, and wash their feet.

- note: Wicked men of Sodom came to Lot's house in the night demanding that he hand
    over the two angels so that they could have sex with him. Lot begged them not
    to, and even offered them both of his young daughters instead. But the evil men
    of Sodom approached Lot's home to break in and the angels reached out and blinded
    the mob.

- note: The angels of the LORD tell Lot and his family to escape Sodom because God
    was going to destroy it. Lot's betrothed sons-in-law did not believe him. The
    angels demanded that Lot leave immediately and run for the hills. Lot begged that
    he instead to the nearby city of Zoar instead of fleeing for the hills, which
    God allowed and spared the city of Zoar.

- note: As the sun rose while Lot, his wife, and his daughters were escaping Sodom;
    The LORD rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot's wife looked
    back at the destruction and became a pillar of salt.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge19.23-26
- note: Lot and his daughters stayed in a cave, rather than stay in Zoar, after fleeing
    Sodom before its destruction. The 2 daughters concocted a plan to make their
    father drunk and sleep with him, to preserve their families line. On two separate
    nights, they did just that and both became pregnant.
