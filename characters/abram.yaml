info:
- note: God commanded Abram to leave his country and his family for a land that He
    will show him. God promised to make him a great nation and will bless him and
    those who bless him, and curse those who dishonor him.

- note: Because of a famine Abram went to Egypt. He told his wife to lie and say she
    was his sister, because she was very beautiful and the Egyptians will want to
    take her for their own. When they did, God afflicted Pharaoh and his house with
    great plagues and Pharaoh sent them away.

  commentary: This a very interesting encounter. By any observation, one would think
    that what Abram did was wrong and sinful, but God used it to get them out of Egypt
    and God does not chastise Abram for this.
- note: Abram left Egypt for Negeb. From Negeb he went east of Bethel to where he
    built his alter, and separated himself from Lot because their possessions were
    growing to greatly that it was causing strife.

- note: God promised the land in Canaan to him and his offspring. God promised to
    make his offspring as numerous as the dust of the earth. Abram moved to the oaks
    of Mambre in Hebron and built the LORD another altar.

- note: When Abram learned his nephew Lot was captured, he took 318 of his trained
    men in pursuit of him. He divided his forces and attacked at night and brought
    back Lot, his possessions, and his people.

- note: The king of Sodom asked Abram for his people in exchange for all the goods
    taken from Abram's battle, but Abram took none of the possessions from the king
    of Sodom, so that he would not be in his debt.
