- note: Jacob loved Joseph more than his otherr sons and made him a roobe off many
    colors. Because Jacob loved him more, his brothers hated Joseph.

- note: Joseph had a dream where he and his brothers were binding sheaves in the field
    and Joseph's sheaf stood upright and the other sheaves bowed down to it. His brother
    hated him for this dream, asking him, in hatred and dibelief, if he would reign
    over them.

- note: Joseph had another dream and told his brothers that the sun and the moon and
    11 stars were bowing down to him. When he told his father, Jacob rebuked him for
    thinking he and his mothere and brothers would bow down to him.

- note: Jacob sent Joseph to pasture the flock with his brothers. Joseph heard they
    had went to Dothan. When he found them there, they conspired to kill him and throw
    him into a pit, planning to say that he was devoured by a fierce animal.

- note: Reuben saved Joseph by convincing their brother not to kill him, but only
    throw him in a pit. So Joseph's brothers took his robe and threw him in an empty
    pit without water. They sat down to eat and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites on their
    way to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph as a slave and they sold him for
    20 shekels of silver.
