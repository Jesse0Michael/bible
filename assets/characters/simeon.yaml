- note: Joseph filled his brothers bags with grain, replaced their money, and gave
    them provisions for the journey. Simeon was bound and kept behind. The brothers
    discovered that they provisions had been refilled. They returned to their father,
    Jacob, and informed him that they must return with Benjamin but Jacob refused
    to send him.

  commentary: The brothers were afraid when they found their provisions refilled because
    they thought they would be accused of stealing it. Jacob refused to let Benjamin
    go because he had already lost Joseph, and now Simeon, and wasn't going to lose
    Benjamin as well.
