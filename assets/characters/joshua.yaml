info:
- note: Moses chose Joshua to fight with Amalek. Moses would stand on the top of the
    hill with his staff raised up. When Moses hand was up, Israel prvaled, when it
    was down they faltered. When Moses was weary, Aaron and Hur put a stone under
    him for him to sit and held up his hands and Joshua overwhelmed Almalek

- note: The LORD called Moses to the mountain to give him the stone tablets conatining
    the law and the commandments. Moses went up with his assistant Joshua. The cloud
    covered the mountain for 6 days, on the 7th it called out to Moses. The appearance
    of the LORD was like a devouring fire on top of the mountain. Moses entered the
    cloud for 40 days and nights.

    with milk and honey. They showed the fruit they collected from the land. They
    told people that they ran into, who were strong, and were affraid. Caleb said
    they should take the land.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Nu13.17-33
- note: After hearing the report on the land from the spies from each tribe, the Israelites
    complained to Moses and Aaron saying it would be better to have died in Egypt
    or the wilderness than to die by sword. Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes and
    cried that the land is extremely good and that they had God on their side and
    should take it.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Nu14.1-9
- note: The LORD was going to smite down the people of Israel for their grumbling,
    but Moses spoke on their behalf. He conviced God to change his mind, but, the
    Israelites would wonder in the wilderness for 40 years until ever grown man who
    grumbled against God has died. Every man over 20 except Caleb and Joshua will
    not be able to enter the land, but it will be given to their children.

    Joshua. The LORD warned Moses and Joshua that the people of Israel will choose
    to follow other gods and He will turn his face from them. He instructed them to
    write down and teach the people of Israel a song to remind them of their covenant.Then
    the LORD commissioned Joshua, commanding him to be strong and courageous for He
    is with him.

  commentary: The angel implies that his is for the LORD, not for Israel, meaning
    the two are not one in the same.
- note: For 6 days, as God commanded, Joshua led the people of Israel, all the men
    of war, 7 priests with 7 trumpets, and the ark of the covenant around the city
    of Jericho one time. On the seventh day they marched around the city 7 times,
    and then shouted, for the LORD had delivered the city of Jericho to them. The
    walls of Jericho fell down flat and the city was captured, sparing only Rahab
    and her family.

- note: Joshua sent spies to the land of Ai who told him that they are few and only
    a few thousand would be required to defeat them. But, when Joshua sent his 3000
    men, they were all defeated and chased off.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Jos7.2-5
- note: Joshua pleas with God for answers of why they were defeated at Ai. God tells
    him it was because of Israel's sin in taking the devoted things from Jericho when
    told not to. Which was done secretly by Achan

  commentary: The devoted things could have been idols, not just treasure or riches
- note: Joshua investigated all of the clans for the hidden plunder from Jericho and
    confronted Achan, who admitted to his sin. They laid the plunder before the LORD.
    All of Israel stoned Achan and burned them and their belongings with fire.
