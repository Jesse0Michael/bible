info:
- note: Blameless and upright. Feared God. Was very wealthy and prosperous, had a
    healthy, large family.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.1-2
- note: Satan accuses God that Job is only blameless and upright because God has protected
    him and given him all things, but if he didn't have those blessings he would curse
    God too his face. God allows Satan to touch everything around Job, but not Job
    himself.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.9-12
- note: In one moment, 4 messengers come to tell Job that his oxen and donkeys were
    killed by Sabean raiders, his sheep were killed by fire from heaven, his camels
    were killed by Chaldean raiders, and his children were all killed in a house that
    collapsed. Even after all this Job tore his robe and worshiped God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job1.13-22
- note: Satan tells God that, though Job still praised him when his possessions and
    children were taken from him, He will surely curse God if his own life was effected.
    God allowed Satan to afflict Job, as long as he did not kill him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.4-6
- note: Satan covered Job's body with sores.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.7-8
- note: Even as His wife asked Job to curse God, he would not.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.9-10
- note: Three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, came to Job to comfort him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.11
- note: Job's friends wept, tore their robes, sprinkled dust on their heads, and sat
    with Job for 7 days and 7 nights and no one spoke a word.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job2.12-13
- note: Job curses the day he was ever born, and wishes he was never conceived.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job3.3-10
- note: He wishes he would have died at child birth, or been born dead, rather than
    to experience the things he had experienced.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job3.11-19
- note: He wishes he was dead, and longs for it, but still has not cursed God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job3.20-26
  commentary: Job acknowledges God's role in surrounding him with suffering, but does
    not curse him.
- note: Job claims God is the source of his suffering, but does not curse him for
    it.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job6.4
- note: Job's friends have asked him to repent from the sin he made that they believe
    caused his suffering. Job asserts his innocence and asks his friends to stop with
    the harsh accusations and instead give him kindness and compassion
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job6.28-30
- note: He looks forward towards his death and expects it to come soon.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job7.6-10
- note: Job turns his complaints to God. He asks why God has treated him so harshly
    and asks God to leave him alone.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job7.11-21
- note: He argues that he would never be able to get an audience with God, and if
    he did God would not listen. He asserts that he is blameless, but God would not
    be summoned to hear his case.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job9.11-21
- note: Job claims, that since he is blameless and that God will not hear his case
    that God is unjust, allowing the destruction of both the wicked and the blameless.
    He knows that if he moves on from his sorrow all will judge that Job was not innocent
    and condemn him for the sin he must have committed. He desires a trial with God
    that his innocence may be pleaded and that God will lift the oppression from him.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job9.22-35
- note: Job pleads to God directly asking for an answer to why he is oppressing him.
    He knows God knows he is innocent. For he does not see as man sees, He has made
    Job and knows he is not guilty.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job10.2-9
- note: He asks God that if he has sinned or is guilty to not remove the affliction
    from him, but if he is judged right to remove the affliction and lift his head
    for he cannot do that on his own because he fears that God would hunt him even
    more.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job10.14-17
- note: He asks God to leave him alone and let him die.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job10.20-22
- note: Job mocks his friends saying that no one is wiser than them.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job12.2-3
- note: Job extols God's wisdom, power, and control over all things. Both good and
    bad, and has the power to change either; lifting up and bringing down, empowering
    and destroying. He is in control of the deceiver and the deceived, the wise man
    and the drunkard, and can change their fate as he chooses.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job12.13-25
- note: Job states that he knows and understands what they are saying about God's
    justice. But he would rather speak with God, for he knows his innocents and his
    friends are only spreading lies.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job13.1-5
- note: Job warns his friends about speaking falsely for God.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job13.6-12
- note: Job pleas his case to God and asks him to remove the suffering from him and
    give him and explanation as to why he is suffering.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job13.20-24
- note: Job reflects on the fragility of human life and that all humans are destined
    to live short lives. He asks that his life would end and that, like a tree has
    a chance to regrow, that he may be renewed. And in his renewed life, God put an
    end to his sin and cover up all of his iniquity.
  ref: https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Job14.7-17
  commentary: The hope to have his sins covered in a new life would not be an admission
    of sin deserving of his current suffering. The hope in a resurrected life where
    all one's sins are wiped clean surely points to Jesus, without Job even realizing.
