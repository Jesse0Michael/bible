- note: 'God commanded Abram to leave his country and his family for a land that He
    will show him. God promised to make him a great nation and will bless him and
    those who bless him, and curse those who dishonor him. '

- note: Abram moved to the land of Canaan, to the Oak of Moreh in Shechem, where Abram
    built his first recorded altar to God.

- note: Because of a famine Abram went to Egypt. He told his wife to lie and say she
    was his sister, because she was very beautiful and the Egyptians will want to
    take her for their own. When they did, God afflicted Pharaoh and his house with
    great plagues and Pharaoh sent them away.

  commentary: This a very interesting encounter. By any observation, one would think
    that what Abram did was wrong and sinful, but God used it to get them out of Egypt
    and God does not chastise Abram for this.
