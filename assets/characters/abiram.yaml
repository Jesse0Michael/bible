- note: Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and On formed a rebellion against Moses, claiming that
    Moses is not holier than the rest of them. Moses told them it is not him but the
    LORD they have grumbled against this day. They argued against Moses for not bringing
    them into the promised land and giving them their inheritance. Those who rebelled
    took their incense in a censer as an offering to the LORD. The glory of the LORD
    appeard angry with their rebellious offering intent on consuming all those who
    rebelled against Moses, but Moses interviened begging to not punish the congragation
    for the sins of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. The ground underneath the tents of
    Korah, Dathan, and Abiram opened up and consumed  them, their families, and all
    of their belongings and the earth closed over top of them. Out of the LORD's glory
    came a fire that consumed the 250 men who offered insense with those who rebelled.
