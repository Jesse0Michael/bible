info:
- note: Moses chose Joshua to fight with Amalek. Moses would stand on the top of the
    hill with his staff raised up. When Moses hand was up, Israel prvaled, when it
    was down they faltered. When Moses was weary, Aaron and Hur put a stone under
    him for him to sit and held up his hands and Joshua overwhelmed Almalek
