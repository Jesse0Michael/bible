info:
- note: Reuben saved Joseph by convincing their brother not to kill him, but only
    throw him in a pit. So Joseph's brothers took his robe and threw him in an empty
    pit without water. They sat down to eat and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites on their
    way to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph as a slave and they sold him for
    20 shekels of silver.
