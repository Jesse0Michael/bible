    The Israelites began to worship Baal of Peor while
    near Moab. This angered the LORD and he begain to plague the people of israelites. Moses ordered the chiefs to kill anyone who has yoked themselves with Baal. A man, named Zimri, who brought a midianit woman, named Cozbi, into his family was brought before the tent of meeting and Phinehas piered the man and the woman with a spear, killing them both and ending the plague. The plague killed 24,000 Israelites.

- note: 'The LORD commanded Moses to go to war with the Midianites. 1,000 men from
    each tribe along with Phinehas armed with vessels and trumpets. They killed all
    the Midianite men along with their 5 kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They
    also killed Balaam. The people of Israel took the women captive and plundered
    their livestock and goods and burned their cities. Moses was angry that they let
    the women live, for he blamed them for the treachery caused at Peor when a plague
    was sent on Israel. So they killed all the males and the older women.'

- note: after the land had been conqured and divided among the tribes and some tribes
    settled back accross the Jordan, those tribes built a large altar that caused
    the people of Israel on the other side of the Jordan to worry they have strayed
    from God. They sent Phinehas and leaders from each tribe to confront them in battle,
    but when they arrived found out that they have not strayed from God but were fearful
    that they would not be seen as true followers of God and therefore built the altar.
